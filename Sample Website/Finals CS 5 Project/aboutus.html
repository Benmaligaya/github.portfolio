        As a structured academic organization made up of distinct but connected components, the University of Rizal System 
        (URS) plans, organizes, and integrates system-wide operations. The public's access to education, research, extension, 
        and production is its main mandate. <br> <br>

        The University is also headed by its president, Dr. Nancy Talavera Pascual, who serves on the Board of Regents, which 
        is the highest governing body. Dr. Marites M. Rio, vice president for research development, extension, and 
        production; Dr. Allan E. Conde, vice president for academic affairs; and Dr. Marvin P. Amoin, vice president for 
        administration and finance, are all there with her. <br> <br>

        Deans, program leaders, campus directors, and unit heads also oversee the university.
        The president serves as the university's leader, spokesperson, and chief executive officer. She oversees all 
        university operations, including programs and policy directives, and engages in associated activities including 
        production, research, education, and extension in addition to her administrative and leadership responsibilities.
